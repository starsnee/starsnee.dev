        <h5>Hi! I'm Rin :3</h5>
    <p>I am a web developer and designer. I am a gamer and a cat lover. I love D&D and fantasy novels, and I'm currently writing my own.</p>
    <p>I love drawing, and have a passion for creating art that is both beautiful and meaningful. I'm currently working on a webcomic called "Ashes of the Celestial Flame"</p>
    <p>I love playing video games, and love the BG3 series, Yakuza series, and Stardew Valley.</p>
    <p>One of my biggest inspirations is the ocean and jellyfish. I have a deep connection to the water and it's creatures.</p>
